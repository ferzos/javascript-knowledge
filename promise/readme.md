# Promise

Promise is an object that represents a value that may not be available yet but will be resolved at some point in the future. Promises are commonly used to handle asynchronous operations, such as making HTTP requests, reading and writing files, and performing database operations.

A Promise is in one of these states:

pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
